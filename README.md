### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for passing by! All my repositories are firstcomers friendly ! Nothing particularly intensive, whether It is Python, JavaScript, NodeJS or anything else. Some repositories are a chance for beginners to learn these technologies through a real world example also to learn collaborating using Git and Github.

- ðŸ¤  I'm a Software engineer. I jump on several technologies without mastering anything in particular.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing in particular; Until I have an epiphany hopefully or I run out of money (hopefully not).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning nothing in particular. I am always interested in programming paradigms patterns and optimization, also data and stream reasoning and processing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on one of my repositories:
  - [WeatherVenue](https://github.com/bacloud14/-WeatherVenue-Issues): a weather web app.
  - [Secluded](https://github.com/bacloud14/Secluded): a web bots experiment (one idea that can just fail or not).
  - [Gamenian](https://github.com/bacloud14/Gamenian): a noval cards game.
  - [Constrained Data Base with Slow Streams](https://github.com/bacloud14/Constrained-Data-Base-with-Slow-Streams): a draft paper.
  - [Timeline miner](https://github.com/bacloud14/timeline-miner): a ML cloud service for time mining.
  - [Datus](https://github.com/bacloud14/Datus): an Android application that extracts files metadata (probably the strongest out there!).
  - Or any other repository. Please do not hesitate to ask a technical or a broad question about anything.  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anyone, anywhere!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to optimise a data processing system, choose of technology or architecturing your data system.

- âš¡ Fun facts (and my opinions): 
  - The original oranges from Southeast Asia were a tangerine-pomelo hybrid, and they were actually green.
  - Actually, FP is so easy to grasp. It is sexier and easier than PP or OO. Anyone with middle school math basics can grasp FP. I mean when you understand what f(x)=y means, that's it. Programmatically the basic is the same. Actually the confusion comes to computer science students first when they learn about memory and assignation which is different than = in math. The problem with FP in Haskell for example, is syntactic sugar; The additions that make it sexy at first but not really later.
  - ðŸ˜ƒ Be optimistic ðŸ˜ƒ.
  - ðŸ¥º People are hard on themselves nowadays, please do not be like that ðŸ¥º.
  - ðŸ˜¡ Emoji integration in Google search is making Internet juicy ðŸ˜¡.
  - ðŸ˜¡ Antivirus is probably a fake business ðŸ˜¡.
  - Work is liberating.
  - ðŸ˜‚ How much narrow specialized you are in one field doesn't necessarily make your status sexier ðŸ˜‚.
  - ðŸ˜‚ Keep reinventing the wheel shamelessly. World will not stop spinning when you are happy about your library ðŸ˜‚.
  - ðŸ˜¡ Dark skin CSS is not the new sexy; It is useful for late work ðŸ˜¡.
  - ðŸ˜ƒ World with Internet is much better. Just like It was with the telephone and television ðŸ˜ƒ.
  - ðŸ¥º Think carefully about licensing your open source stuff. ðŸ¥º.
