### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for passing by! All my repositories are firstcomers friendly ! Nothing particularly intensive, whether It is Python, JavaScript, NodeJS or anything else. Some repositories are a chance for beginners to learn these technologies through a real world example also to learn collaborating using Git and Github.

- ðŸ¤  I'm a Software engineer. I jump on several technologies without mastering anything in particular.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing in particular; Until I have an epiphany hopefully or I run out of money (hopefully not).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning nothing in particular. I am always interested in programming paradigms patterns and optimization, also data and stream reasoning and processing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on one of my repositories:
  - [WeatherVenue](https://github.com/bacloud14/WeatherVenue): a weather web app.
  - [Secluded repo](https://github.com/bacloud14/Secluded) [website](https://www.botstudies.com): a web bots experiment (one idea that can just fail or not).
  - [Gamenian](https://github.com/bacloud14/Gamenian): a noval cards game.
  - [Constrained Data Base with Slow Streams](https://github.com/bacloud14/Constrained-Data-Base-with-Slow-Streams): a draft paper.
  - [Timeline miner](https://github.com/bacloud14/timeline-miner): a ML cloud service for time mining.
  - [Datus](https://github.com/bacloud14/Datus): an Android application that extracts files metadata (probably the strongest out there!).
  - Or any other repository. Please do not hesitate to ask a technical or a broad question about anything.  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anyone, anywhere!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to optimise a data processing system, choose of technology or architecturing your data system. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: b@cloud14[[(at)]]gmail(dot)c0m
- âš¡ Fun facts (and my opinions): 
  - The original oranges from Southeast Asia were a tangerine-pomelo hybrid, and they were actually green.
