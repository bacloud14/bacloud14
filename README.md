### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for passing by! 

- ðŸ¤  I'm a graduate in Artificial Intelligence but I am a Software engineer (a better label for me). I jump on several technologies without mastering anything in particular.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing in particular; Until I have an epiphany hopefully or I run out of money (hopefully not).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning nothing in particular. I am always interested in programming paradigms patterns and optimization, also data and stream reasoning and processing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on one of my repositories:
  - [Gamenian](https://github.com/bacloud14/Gamenian): a noval cards game.
  - [Constrained Data Base with Slow Streams](https://github.com/bacloud14/Constrained-Data-Base-with-Slow-Streams): a draft paper.
  - [Timeline miner](https://github.com/bacloud14/timeline-miner): a ML cloud service for time mining.
  - [Datus](https://github.com/bacloud14/Datus): an Android application that extracts files metadata (probably the strongest out there!).
  - Or any other repository. Please do not hesitate to ask a technical or a broad question about anything.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anyone, anywhere!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to optimise a data processing system, choose of technology or architecturing your data system.

- âš¡ Fun fact: The original oranges from Southeast Asia were a tangerine-pomelo hybrid, and they were actually green.
