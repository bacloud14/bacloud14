### Hi there 👋

Thank you for passing by! 

- 🤠 I'm a graduate in Artificial Intelligence but I am a Software engineer (a better label for me). I jump on several technologies without mastering anything in particular.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on nothing in particular; Until I have an epiphany hopefully or I run out of money (hopefully not).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing in particular. I am always interested in programming paradigms patterns and optimization, also data and stream reasoning and processing.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on one of my repositories:
  - [SunnySunday](https://github.com/bacloud14/SunnySunday): a weather web app.
  - [Gamenian](https://github.com/bacloud14/Gamenian): a noval cards game.
  - [Constrained Data Base with Slow Streams](https://github.com/bacloud14/Constrained-Data-Base-with-Slow-Streams): a draft paper.
  - [Timeline miner](https://github.com/bacloud14/timeline-miner): a ML cloud service for time mining.
  - [Datus](https://github.com/bacloud14/Datus): an Android application that extracts files metadata (probably the strongest out there!).
  - Or any other repository. Please do not hesitate to ask a technical or a broad question about anything.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with anyone, anywhere!
- 💬 Ask me about how to optimise a data processing system, choose of technology or architecturing your data system.

- ⚡ Fun facts (and my opinions): 
  - The original oranges from Southeast Asia were a tangerine-pomelo hybrid, and they were actually green.
  - Actually, FP is so easy to grasp. It is sexier and easier than PP or OO. Anyone with middle school math basics can grasp FP. I mean when you understand what f(x)=y means, that's it. Programmatically the basic is the same. Actually the confusion comes to computer science students first when they learn about memory and assignation which is different than = in math. The problem with FP in Haskell for example, is syntactic sugar; The additions that make it sexy at first but not really later.
  - 😠 Retweet bots are shit and should be stopped 😠.
  - 😡 Emoji integration in Google search is shit and should be stopped 😡.
  - 😡 Antivirus is probably a fake business 😡.
  - ❤️ Github is amazing, so is Mr Linus ❤️.
  - 😠 Discord is for game streaming and not for programming 😠.
  - 😂 You don't need to be so nerdy. Rather try not to be 😂.
  - 🥺 Try not to repeat 'I' several times in one paragraph 🥺 ...
  - 😂 How much narrow specialized you are in one field doesn't necessarily make your status sexier 😂.
  - 😂 Keep reinventing the wheel shamelessly. World will not stop spinning when you are happy about your library 😂.
  - 😡 Developers are not pipe builders for data scientist 😡.
  - 🥺 A data scientist without Pandas and Numpy should still be a data scientist 🥺.
  - 🥺 Avoid being obsessed with IQ like fellas showing in Quora.com; It is not healthy 🥺.
  - 😡 Dark skin is not the new sexy 😡.
  - 😃 World with Internet is much better. Just like It was with the telephone and television 😃.
  - 😃 Try learning a new language before judging a lot someone's English 😃.
  - ❤️ English is one beautiful language ❤️.
  - 🥺 Programming is hard, and programmers should be valued 🥺.
  - 😡 Advertising in the age of Internet is shit. Everyone can look for himself. Advertising in the Internet is like shiting in a garden. Now I think you can advertise for your product, it is now over 😡.
  - 🥺 Once, Most Hardware was sufficient for good games. I mean, the average personal computer were fit for the best games and we can make it happen again so more people play good games 🥺.
  - Think carefully about licensing your open source stuff. Cowboys are not fooling around and they won't value your work once you let them use it anyway. you don't want to cry later when big tech don't give a shit about you.
